## Project Summary 📋
* Build a command-line application from scratch to manage an employee database
* Essentially: build a content management system using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySql
* Use the npm 'Inquirer' package

-----
## Challenges Faced ⚔️  
* I have faced numerous challenges with mySQL during this assignment. Through several attempts at reinstalling the app, it has worked and failed several times, which has halted development at different stages
* In my own research I have attempted several different solutions using online resources
* Having addressed this issue over three separate tutoring sessions, the problem had been solved only for the same issue to keep presenting itself (MySQL does not consistently accept my password credentials)
* Instructors and TAs have all examined this issue, and have not found solutions to this problem -- they have suggested that I highlight this in my submission
* Note: the code itself functions properly when used on a separate machine, however, I am unable to demonstrate it locally and therefore cannot share a video walkthrough

## How to Install 📝  
* To get started, open your terminal and run the following commands:
* `npm install mysql2`
* `npm install inquirer`
* `npm install console.table --save`

-----
## How to Use 📝  
* Navigate to db/connection.js and input your mySQL user and password
* run database, schema, and seeds files by running the following commands in mysql shell:
* `source db/db.sql`
* `source db/schema.sql`
* `source db/seeds.sql`
* Click through to your root directory, and write the following command in your terminal:
* `node index`
* Navigate through the prompts using your terminal
